## Description:

Boba Hour is a website for boba or bubble tea drinkers who are interested in meeting other people while enjoying an Asian style, cool beverage. This site invites visitors to post their tea cafe location with the intention of having another visitor respond by traveling to the posted locale. The hope is to have an amicable conversation, socialize or possibly make a new friend.

## User Stories:

1. I am a user who wants to meet new people locally. I want to connect with someone at a bubble tea location to talk while I enjoy my boba tea and possibly trade personal information to get together again.
2. As a user who loves trendy beverages, Iâ€™d like to be able to socialize with other tea or boba aficionados at a tea cafe and have a casual chat about current events, family, work or hobbies.
3. I am a user from out of town. When I travel or explore a new city, I like to rest my feet and refresh myself at a tea shop, as well as, meet the local people in town or meet other travelers to enhance my travel and life experience.

## Technologies Used:

The technologies used for Boba Hour is React JSX, React Bootstrap and Axios. CSS Grid and Flexbox were also used to style the pages.

## Getting Started/Installation:

This application can be used by pulling it up on GitHub, forking it to your personal repository, then cloning and copying it into your terminal. The next step is to run npm install to install the required dependencies, then npm run start on your terminal to run the application in the browser. Then click onto the website and enjoy, otherwise you can also pull it up on Heroku.

## Contribution Guidelines:

Contributors can open an issue on this repository at https://github.com/SuzannAdams/boba_frontend if there are suggestions to improve this application.

## Problems & Difficulties:

1. It was difficult to deploy the Django API to Heroku
2. Setting up the application to accept uploaded images was also a challenge.
3. The CSS styling used create the desired look took some research and consultation from peers.

## Future Additions:

In the near future, this web app will include a user signup and login, as well as, include Google Maps when a location is opened to provide directions and a map. To develop this application into a lucrative site in a later future date, it will become a network of boba tea shops and registered users who can also use the site as a punch card that is redeemable for discounts from the shop owners who have joined the network.
